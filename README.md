Mobile app for the digital substitution schedule of Lessing-Gymnasium Karlsruhe.

## Features

- **Substitution Schedule**: Automatic download for today and tomorrow with offline availability
- **PDF Viewer**: Integrated display with zoom, sharing and external app integration
- **Weather Data**: Live data from the school weather station with charts
- **Dark Mode**: Eye-friendly Material Design 3 theme
- **Offline-First**: Intelligent caching with automatic network detection

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK 3.8.0+
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- For iOS development: Xcode and CocoaPods

### Installation & Setup

#### End Users
**[Latest Release](https://github.com/luka-loehr/LGKA/releases/latest)** ‚Äì ARM64 APK for Android 5.0+

#### Developers
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/luka-loehr/LGKA.git
cd LGKA

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app in debug mode
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d [device-id]
```

## Development Commands

### Testing & Analysis
```bash
# Analyze code for issues
flutter analyze

# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget_test.dart
```

### Building
```bash
# Build optimized APK (~10MB per architecture)
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi

# Build for specific architecture
flutter build apk --release --target-platform=android-arm64

# Build for Play Store
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### Configuration Management
```bash
# Update app configuration (icons, version, etc.)
./scripts/update_app_config.sh

# Apply configuration changes from app_config.yaml
dart run scripts/apply_app_config.dart

# Generate app icons
dart run scripts/generate_app_icons.dart
```

### Maintenance
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
flutter clean

# Check outdated dependencies
flutter pub outdated

# Upgrade dependencies
flutter pub upgrade
```

## Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The app follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer** (`lib/data/`): Repositories and preference management
- **State Management** (`lib/providers/`): Riverpod providers for reactive state
- **Services** (`lib/services/`): Business logic for offline caching, weather data, and file handling
- **Presentation** (`lib/screens/`): UI screens with Material Design 3 dark theme
- **Navigation** (`lib/navigation/`): GoRouter-based declarative routing

### Key Implementation Details

#### Offline-First Design
- Intelligent caching with network detection and automatic fallback
- Preloading of PDFs and weather data on app start
- 5-second retry intervals for weather data when offline

#### PDF Management
- Automatic download and caching for today/tomorrow schedules
- Syncfusion Flutter PDF for processing, pdfx for viewing
- Date-tracked caching in app documents directory

#### Weather Integration
- Real-time data from school weather station API
- Data downsampling for chart performance optimization
- Syncfusion Charts with Material 3 theming

#### Authentication & Security
- Password-based authentication with secure preference storage
- Session management with automatic logout

### State Management

The app uses Riverpod throughout for dependency injection and reactive state. Main providers are located in `lib/providers/app_providers.dart`:

- `preferencesManagerProvider`: Manages user preferences
- `pdfRepositoryProvider`: Handles PDF state and caching
- `weatherDataProvider`: StateNotifier for weather data with offline fallback
- `reviewServiceProvider`: Manages app review prompts
- Authentication and navigation state providers

### Navigation Flow

Routes are defined in `lib/navigation/app_router.dart`:

- `/welcome`: First-time user onboarding
- `/auth`: Password authentication screen
- `/`: Home screen with tabs for PDFs and weather
- `/pdf-viewer`: PDF viewing with sharing capabilities
- `/settings`: App preferences
- `/legal`: Legal information and privacy policy

## Configuration

### App Configuration
App settings are centralized in `app_config/app_config.yaml`:

- App identity (name, package, description)
- Version management (version_name, version_code)
- Platform-specific settings:
  - Android: min_sdk: 21, target_sdk: 34
  - iOS: deployment_target: 12.0
- Icon configuration with automatic generation

Apply changes with: `dart run scripts/apply_app_config.dart`

### Build Configuration
- Minimum Dart SDK: 3.8.0
- Android: Min SDK 21, Target SDK 36
- iOS: Deployment target 12.0
- R8 optimization enabled for smaller APK sizes
- Split APKs reduce download size to ~10MB per architecture
- ProGuard rules configured for release builds

## Development Guidelines

### Theme
- Dark-only Material Design 3 theme defined in `lib/theme/app_theme.dart`
- Consistent color scheme throughout the app
- Haptic feedback abstracted through `HapticService`

### File Operations
- `FileOpenerService` handles PDF opening and sharing
- Support for both internal viewer and external apps
- Graceful error handling with user feedback

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation with offline fallbacks throughout
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms for network operations

### Testing
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical user flows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
2. **iOS build issues**: Update CocoaPods with `pod repo update`
3. **Android build issues**: Check SDK versions in `android/app/build.gradle`
4. **Network issues**: Verify API endpoints and network permissions

### Performance Tips
- Use `flutter analyze` for code quality checks
- Monitor memory usage during PDF operations
- Optimize chart rendering for large weather datasets
